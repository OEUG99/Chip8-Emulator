Running `main.py` after installing the requirements will start the emulator with a default game. The emulator is 100% compliant with all [Chip-8 specifications](http://devernay.free.fr/hacks/chip8/C8TECH10.HTM)

A fully compliant CPU is implemented [here](https://github.com/OEUG99/Chip8-Emulator/blob/master/src/cpu.py).

Steps to run.
1. Clone the git repo `git clone https://github.com/OEUG99/Chip8-Emulator.git`
2. Install the requirements `pip3 install requirements.txt`
3. run `python src/main.py`
